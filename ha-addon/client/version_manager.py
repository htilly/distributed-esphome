    its Python floor to 3.12 and the shipped worker image was still on 3.11,
    so every 2026.7.x candidate was excluded before the version match ran

    raise its floor again, and a worker running a stale image will hit this
    exact wall each time. Name the cause and the fix instead of pasting the

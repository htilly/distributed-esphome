# Security review 2026-08-27 (finding O-002 / A-004): every real ESPHome
# release name is dot-separated segments of digits, optionally followed by
# a pre-release tag (a/b/rc/dev + optional digits) — e.g. "2026.3.1",
# "2026.3.0b3", "2026.3.0.dev20260521". Confirmed against every legitimate
# source that feeds a version string into this module: the PyPI release
# list (`main._fetch_pypi_versions`), the UI version picker, and the
# per-target pin field — none of them ever produce '/', '\', or '..'.
# This allowlist charset therefore rejects nothing a real caller sends.
#
# Attacker chain this closes: `_venv_path()` used to join a caller-supplied
# version string directly onto `VERSIONS_BASE` with no validation, and
# `_install()` unconditionally `shutil.rmtree()`s whatever that resolves
# to before reinstalling. A version string like "../../../data" (reachable
# via POST /ui/api/esphome-version or the per-target pin endpoint, both of
# which only rejected the empty string) walks outside VERSIONS_BASE — and
# because this add-on container runs as root with /config mounted
# read-write and /data / /config as siblings on the same filesystem, a
# single crafted request could recursively delete the user's entire Home
# Assistant configuration tree. The same module is imported worker-side
# too, driven by the job's `esphome_version` field.
